# csm_whether_the_weather_homerwork6

## Project/Page Overview

The page functionality works close to as intended. It meets most of the user story. Let me explain: Current city weather information (icon included), including UV index (though there is no responsive color indicator accompanied with it). The five-day forecast populates cleanly as well. Additionally the local data/recent city search populates according (although not visually ideally). Each of the buttons created by the previous searches also functions with a re-search mechanic as well. 

The one thing I had difficulty with was getting the previous localdata to load.
